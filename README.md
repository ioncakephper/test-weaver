## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Comprehensive Testing Suite**: Pre-configured with Jest for unit and integration testing. Includes coverage reporting out-of-the-box to ensure code quality.
- **Automated Code Quality**: A strict, pre-configured setup using ESLint and Prettier to catch errors, enforce best practices, and maintain a consistent code style across all files (`.js`, `.md`, `.json`).
- **Enforced Documentation Standards**: Integrated `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` to require JSDoc comments for all functions, improving code clarity and long-term maintainability.
- **Living Documentation**: Custom automation scripts (`npm run docs:all`) that keep your `README.md` perpetually up-to-date by generating the project structure, a table of contents, and a list of available scripts. This eliminates documentation drift.
- **Automated Release Workflow**: Integrated `release-please` to automate version bumping, `CHANGELOG.md` generation, and GitHub releases based on the Conventional Commits specification.
- **One-Command Pre-Commit Preparation**: A single `npm run ready` command that formats, lints, and updates all documentation, guaranteeing every commit is clean, consistent, and professional. This command is designed to be run before every commit.
- **Robust Project Defaults**: Thoughtfully pre-configured with `.gitignore`, `.prettierignore`, and a ready-to-use Continuous Integration (CI) workflow for GitHub Actions.
- **Automated Dependency Updates**: Dependabot integration to keep your dependencies up-to-date and secure.

<!-- START AVAILABLE SCRIPTS -->
<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN npm run docs:scripts TO UPDATE -->

### Automated Documentation

- `npm run docs:all`: A convenience script that updates all documentation sections: table of contents, available scripts, and project structure.
- `npm run docs:scripts`: Updates the "Available Scripts" section in `README.md` with this script.
- `npm run docs:structure`: Updates the project structure tree in `README.md`.
- `npm run toc`: Generates a Table of Contents in `README.md` using `doctoc`.

### Code Quality & Formatting

- `npm run check`: A convenience script that runs the linter.
- `npm run fix`: A convenience script that formats code and then fixes lint issues.
- `npm run format`: Formats all JavaScript, Markdown, and JSON files with Prettier.
- `npm run lint`: Lints all JavaScript and Markdown files using ESLint.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fixes linting issues in all JavaScript and Markdown files.

### Core Development

- `npm run start`: Runs the application using `node src/index.js`.
- `npm run test`: Runs all tests with Jest and generates a coverage report.
- `npm run test:watch`: Runs Jest in watch mode, re-running tests on file changes.

## A Focus on Quality and Productivity

This starter template is more than just a collection of files; it's a workflow designed to maximize developer productivity and enforce high-quality standards from day one. The core philosophy is to **automate the tedious and error-prone tasks** so you can focus on what matters: building great software.

### The Cost of Stale Documentation

In many projects, the `README.md` quickly becomes outdated. Manually updating the project structure or list of scripts is an easily forgotten chore.

`test-weaver` solves this problem with its custom documentation scripts:

- `scripts/update-readme-structure.js`: Saves you from manually drawing out file trees. What might take 5-10 minutes of careful, manual work (and is often forgotten) is now an instant, accurate, and repeatable command.
- `scripts/update-readme-scripts.js`: Ensures that your project's capabilities are always documented. It reads directly from `package.json`, so the documentation can't lie. It even reminds you to describe your scripts, promoting good habits.

### The Power of Workflow Scripts

Chaining commands together is a simple but powerful concept. The `fix`, `docs:all`, and `ready` scripts are designed to create a seamless development experience.

- Instead of remembering to run `prettier` then `eslint --fix`, you just run `npm run fix`.
- Instead of running three separate documentation commands, you just run `npm run docs:all`.
- And most importantly, before you commit, you run `npm run ready`. This single command is your pre-flight check. It guarantees that every commit you push is not only functional but also perfectly formatted, linted, and documented. This discipline saves countless hours in code review and prevents messy commit histories.

By embracing this automation, `test-weaver` helps you build better software, faster.

## üì¶ Release & Versioning

This project uses [`release-please`](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to automate releases, versioning, and changelog generation. This ensures a consistent and hands-off release process, relying on the Conventional Commits specification.

### How it Works

1. **Conventional Commits**: All changes merged into the `main` branch should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification (e.g., `feat: add new feature`, `fix: resolve bug`).
2. **Release Pull Request**: `release-please` runs as a GitHub Action and monitors the `main` branch for new Conventional Commits. When it detects changes that warrant a new release (e.g., a `feat` commit for a minor version, a `fix` commit for a patch version), it automatically creates a "Release PR" with a title like `chore(release): 1.2.3`.
3. **Review and Merge**: This Release PR contains:
   - An updated `CHANGELOG.md` with all changes since the last release.
   - A bumped version number in `package.json`.
   - Proposed release notes. Review this PR, and once satisfied, merge it into `main`.
4. **Automated GitHub Release & Publish**: Merging the Release PR triggers two final, sequential actions:
   - The `release-please` action creates a formal GitHub Release and a corresponding Git tag (e.g., `v1.1.0`).
   - The creation of this release then triggers the `publish.yml` workflow, which automatically publishes the package to the npm registry.

### Creating a New Release

To create subsequent releases, simply merge changes into the `main` branch using Conventional Commits. `release-please` will handle the rest by creating a Release PR. Once that PR is merged, the new version will be released automatically.

#### Your First Release

To bootstrap the process and create your very first release:

1. Ensure your `package.json` version is at a sensible starting point (e.g., `1.0.0`).
2. Make at least one commit to the `main` branch that follows the Conventional Commits specification. A good first commit would be: `feat: Initial release`.
3. Push your commit(s) to `main`. The `release-please` action will run and create your first Release PR.
4. Review and merge this PR. This will trigger the creation of your `v1.0.0` GitHub Release and publish the package to npm.

For more details, refer to the [release-please documentation](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please#how-it-works).

## ‚úçÔ∏è Linting for Documentation

This project uses the [`eslint-plugin-jsdoc`](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc) package to enforce that all functions, classes, and methods are properly documented using JSDoc comments. This helps maintain a high level of code quality and makes the codebase easier for new and existing developers to understand.

### How to Check for Missing Documentation

You can check the entire project for missing or incomplete docblocks by running the standard linting command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

ESLint will scan your JavaScript files and report any undocumented code as a warning.

### Example

Consider the following function in your code without any documentation:

```javascript
function calculateArea(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}
```

When you run `npm run lint`, ESLint will produce a warning similar to this:

```plaintext
/path/to/your/project/src/your-file.js
  1:1  warning  Missing JSDoc for function 'calculateArea'  jsdoc/require-jsdoc
```

To fix this, you would add a JSDoc block that describes the function, its parameters, and what it returns. Most modern code editors (like VS Code) can help by generating a skeleton for you if you type `/**` and press Enter above the function.

**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the area of a rectangle.
 * @param {number} width The width of the rectangle.
 * @param {number} height The height of the rectangle.
 * @returns {number} The calculated area.
 */
function calculateArea(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}
```

After adding the docblock, running `npm run lint` again will no longer show the warning for this function.
